# clojure-trie-react-experiment

`one word autcomplete` experiment with the trie data structure, ring (clojure), lein-ring,
react, and react-material

## Usage

`lein ring server 9000` to start off the clojure server (do this from the base directory)

`cd client && npm install && npm start` to start off the client


## Disclosure

The client is a modified version of the webpack example of the material ui with react
link is here :-> https://github.com/callemall/material-ui-webpack-example/tree/4dba4758a56756921e2ec75b352c41d1325a6241

So what I'm saying is you thought I'm a smart cookie, I'm not harr harr.
However the modified parts are mine. So maybe I'm a smart cookie crumb (heehee)

## Note for future me

The whole axios `this` problem was solved via this little tip
